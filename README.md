# LLM-to-Digital-Human Pipeline

A modular pipeline that turns text conversations into lifelike digital human videos by integrating:

- **LLM API** for conversational language generation  
- **GPT-SoVITS** for high-quality text-to-speech (TTS)  
- **MuseTalk** for lip-syncing audio to a talking avatar  

This project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow from user input → dialogue → speech → animated digital human video.
